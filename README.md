First attempt at learning how to use node.js.

1) To install, download the latest version of node.js.
2) From the root git directory run 'npm install'
3) Register a client ID and secret with the SLC Sandbox.  Replace the values in <repo>/routes/index.js with yours.
4) From <repo home run 'node app.js'
